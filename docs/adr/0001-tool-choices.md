Facing the concern of completing a technical assignment with the following requirements:

- Architecture diagrams
- AWS Serverless Backend API serving JSON responses
- Interactive JavaScript client displaying sorted or filtered images based on API response(s)
- UI image overlay based on user interaction
- 1 week to complete

And prioritising these principles:

- Test-Driven Development
- Code-first tools
- Automation friendly

Then I adopt these tools

- [Mermaid markdown](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) for architecture and scenario diagrams - code first and easy to maintain
- [Severless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) for API development - facility to run tests and instances locally
- [Vue framework](https://vuejs.org/) for UI - core team develops and maintaints build and testing tools
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) for package management - default and includes security analysis
